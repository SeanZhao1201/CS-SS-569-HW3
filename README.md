# Social Science Interactive Graphic Project

## Overview

This project is dedicated to creating an interactive graphic for exploring social science data. The interactive plot is deployable as a webpage, allowing users to interact with the data in various ways such as subsetting data displayed, changing variables plotted, transforming variables, and adding summaries.

The goal is to provide an interactive tool that goes beyond what a static plot can deliver, enhancing the ability to explore and understand the dataset.

## Data

The interactive graphict uses the `gapminder.org` data as an alternative, ensuring not to replicate interactives that are already available on the website.

## Tools

The implementation of the interactive graphic must involve a programming language. While you may choose any suitable tools for this purpose, if you are primarily familiar with R, it is highly recommended to use the Shiny package, which allows for the creation of interactive web applications directly from R.

## Installation

To run the interactive graphic on your local machine, you will need to have R and the Shiny package installed.

## Usage

After installing the necessary tools and downloading the project, you can launch the interactive graphic locally.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome.

## Submission

For the purposes of homework submission:

-   Submit the interactive graphic by zipping the folder containing `ui.R` and `server.R` files along with any required additional scripts or data.
-   Include a brief description (maximum 3 paragraphs) of the interactive, outlining the data used, the purpose of the interactive, the goals achieved, and the methods used to achieve them.
-   Ensure the code is executable on another machine. Verify this before submitting by running the interactive on a friend's computer.
-   If there are any issues or incomplete features, document these in your submission write-up and provide as much detail as possible about the progress and remaining barriers.
